# Starting this thing

## Just go inside backend and run `npm install`, after that run `npm run start`.

## With backend running, open another terminal and navigate to frontend, run `npm install` and when ready run `npm run start`, this will serve your application in http://localhost:8080.

## Obs: The frontend is capable of reconnect with backend automatilly, so if you turn off the backend while front still running, it will try to reconnect to backend.
